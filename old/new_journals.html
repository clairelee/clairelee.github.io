      <!--  Well, this is week 10. We went kayaking yesterday and that was SO fun. KP and I sucked at paddling but due to our inability to paddle correctly, we were face-to-face with cute harbor seals! Here are some of my final thoughts: I'm surprised they launch sites that still have bugs. Especially when the bugs would take about 5 seconds to fix. I'm annoyed when the bugs I have reported don't get fixed, and it keeps glaring out at me every runthrough I do of the website. I am thankful to be placed on so many different projects. I will miss everyone here.-->

        <big><b>7/31/16 Personal Reflection</big></b><br><br>
        I just finished the 8th week of my internship, and I only have two weeks to go. That makes me sad. I really enjoy working at Razorfish and seeing all the employees every day. I love the food trucks on Tuesdays and Fridays. On Friday I took a lengthy lunch break, ate a clam chowder bread bowl at Boudin, and walked a lap around Pier 39. It's so interesting to work across the street from Pier 39. When I'm too late to catch the Chariot shuttle and take the F Muni line to work, I love jaywalking across that 6-way street. Definitely my favorite street to jaywalk ever. I will miss that. I love bagel Mondays and donut Fridays. I love working on the HPE team, even though I'm barely attending those meetings anymore since I'm so busy with Visa. Visa has my hands full!! We keep pushing back launch. There's five different releases now when there was only supposed to be three. Each release is pushed back later and later as well. Release three just happened or is happening tomorrow, when it was supposed to happen two Fridays ago. I guess that's what happens in the real world. The website we made is super cool though, but I would never go on it LOL. But it is very 2016 VR and edgy and new. Razorfish is known for its new, cutting-edge, "here for tomorrow" desgins. It's amazing to work at a LEADING digital agency. I didn't even know digital agencies existed. I have learned so much more about how the world works in the past 8 weeks. We also have weekly intern training programs on Thursdays but I missed a few. It's cool to hear about what Razorfish has done before, such as T-Mobile and Mercedes Benz. I can't believe we made Spotify Year In Review! I love Year In Reviews! I love Razorfish.

        <big><b>7/29/16 Effective Leadership</big></b><br><br>
        Mimi, the chair of my 15 person committee, is an effective leader. I was appointed to her committee in May to help plan a leadership conference for 700 people in November. We had six months to create this conference from scratch. Mimi led me and the other 14 committee members through weekly meetings altogether, and had biweekly one-on-ones with each individual committee member so she could make sure we were up-to-date on our tasks. I can attribute Mimi's effectiveness from the structural, human resource, and symbolic frames.

 <br> <br>

We had six months to plan this to completion, so we started off by establishing goals for ourselves. By establishing goals, we are outlining what we want to achieve in these six months. In addition, we established expectations that we have for Mimi and each other. We knew what we had to do, and everything was outlined well. Mimi had us create timelines for ourselves, so we could map out everything we needed to do in the six months. Mimi is definitely a leader that employs the structural frame.


<br> <br>
Mimi also demonstrates the human resource frame. She had biweekly one-on-ones with the 14 committee members! We each had different positions and different personalities, so the way Mimi dealt with us was different. For example, if someone has a stronger initiative, Mimi did not need to do heavy hand-holding such as outlining due dates. If someone is more lazy or doesn't seem to always pull their weight, Mimi would establish due dates for the committee member to follow.

 <br> <br>

By far, Mimi demonstrates the symbolic frame. She was a member of this committee for the past two years before becoming the chair. She always had stories to tell, tips and recommendations, and great advice since she had so much expertise planning this conference. She reminded us about the passion she had for this conference, and helped us find our passion as well. We had two milestone meetings that were super fun. Mimi had a clear vision and set plan for us and the conference, which is probably why she was chosen to be the chair of the committee. In addition, Mimi won awards for her time serving as the chair of this committee, so everyone knows she is a great leader.

 <br> <br>

After reading the assigned pieces on leaders in corporate, government, and nonprofit sectors, I do think that leaders in the different sectors need to have particular personal attributes and skill sets for their particular career sector and adopt certain frame preferences. For example, the Home Depot Bob Nardelli clearly had leadership experience, but not retail experience. He led Home Depot on a dull few years with no rise in value, and all the employees disliked him. He should have been more willing to adopt new practices and kept his eyes and ears open to see and hear what was going wrong. He had to understand that Home Depot was a different company than where he was previously, and that the employees, especially the in-store helpers, needed different strategies. Leaders must be willing to adopt new practices in new environment, but the overall leadership style should be able to withstand. A leader is a leader, after all.

        <big><b>7/21/16 Managing Your Boss</big></b><br><br>
        All five of the tips offered in the video are useful, but the ones that stand out to me the most are to 1) clarify roles and expectations, and 2) get constant feedback. The first tip to clarify roles and expectations is huge. We need to know what we are doing at our internships and what we are expected to complete. Ask questions, because as an intern, we are learning from the company and our supervisors. If roles are not clarified early on, perhaps we could be doing something completely wrong. Our internships should benefit both ourselves and the company, so clarifying what we are expected to do is important.
<br><br>
Some of these tips help me in managing my own relationship with my internship supervisor by helping me understand what my role is at my workplace and what I should be working towards to. My ten weeks of my internship are almost up, and it is safe to say I have learned a great deal. One thing I could do is to ask for feedback more and make sure I am doing everything properly. I have weekly check-ins with one of my bosses so we are pretty clear with what my role is in the company and what projects I should be working on. However, I don't ask anyone how I am doing. Maybe I am scared to hear the answer, but I'm pretty sure I'm doing great! I have definitely earned the trust of one of my project managers, as she puts me in the lead for small agenda items where I am leading a group of full-time employees across America.
<br><br>
In regard to my current internship, "don't waste your boss's time" applies the least, but it is still applicable. I don't waste my boss's time as I am constantly doing work 9 to 5 each day, but I also am not working with alongside my boss each day. I do my own projects that she oversees, so if I were to waste time, it doesn't affect my boss. In addition, "earn his trust" should be a general life tip: be responsible and do good work. Doing that will allow you to earn someone's trust.
<br><br>
A cultural difference that would make some of these tips less useful than others would be a culture where talking isn't encouraged. I could be totally off-base, but I took Social Psychology last semester and we learned that the Japanese are very individually-oriented. Asking for constant feedback could come across as annoying and perhaps like you don't know what you are doing.
<br><br>
All in all, these five tips are great tips to follow. One thing I would like to point out is that it was unfortunate that the video kept referring to a boss as "he" and "him." Bosses can be female too!

        <big><b>7/07/16 Monarchs, Lords, and Serfs</big></b><br><br>
        It was nice to have this assignment/reading after we did the organizational structure analysis of our workplace two weeks back. I think this piece by Bolman and Deal brings up some interesting points and comparisons of feudal hierarchies to modern organizations. It captures some of the nuances involving the roles of leaders, middle managers, and line staff in my organization, but it is not a direct fit. The "line staff" at my organization have more of a say than the serfs in feudal hierarchies. I believe this piece's generalizations of the roles of leaders, middle managers, and line staff could be fit more properly to a company structure such as McDonald's. I don't know the actual structure of McDonald's but I would guess the monarchs as the global CEOs and their executive teams, middle managers as the manager of each store, and line staff as the cashiers and burger makers. On the contrast, my company, Razorfish, has a bit more levels. There are is the global executive team (monarchs), but then there is regional executive teams, and leaders in each department, senior associates, and then the general associates (possibly serfs). There are hundreds of leaders in-between that cannot all be categorized as "middle managers."
<br><br>
I think I've mentioned this in another discussion, but for one of the clubs I'm in I manage a committee of 15 others. I am the chair, I have 2 executive assistants, and 14 committee members. To me, that also seems to fit the "Monarchs, Lords and Serfs" pattern. I am able to draw some comparisons of nuances in this article to my perception of McDonald's and my committee. The monarchs have a powerful inner circle, operates behind the scenes (when do you ever hear about the top-level McDonald's decision-makers?), but controls the flow of the entire company. They can be overwhelmed, and I definitely am with my committee. Lords govern their particular domains and report to the monarch.The lords are often constant demands, which my executive assistants definitely are. Serfs feel vulnerable and helpless. I cannot speak for the line staff, but in today's 2016 working places and laws I believe one's opinion is more easily to be heard. So this one is not as comparable.
<br><br>
Like I have mentioned several times before, the cultural norms at my workplace (Razorfish SF) are what I have been familiar with my whole life living in the Bay Area, so the last question of the prompt is a bit harder for me to answer. But on the topic of chronemics, time is treated very highly in my workplace. We have daily stand-ups in the morning and reviews/triages in the afternoon so it is very important to use the time in-between each meeting to carry out your tasks so you can have something to present in the afternoon.

        <big><b>6/29/16 Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</big></b><br><br>
        <u>RECALL</u><br>

Situation:  It was Wednesday night and my math homework was due at 11:59PM and I hadn't started it yet. I skipped my weekly Wednesday night hip-hop exercise class at the RSF so I could finish the homework before the deadline.
<br>
Need taking precedence: Esteem (I need to get good grades.)
<br>
Need being sacrificed: Physiological (Exercise is needed for me to stay fit and healthy.)
<br><br>


<u>REFLECT</u><br>

When looked at broadly, Maslow's theory is a useful way to better understand your needs and the needs of others. It provides us with categories that each motivation and feeling can fall under. These are needs that everyone generally has. If you can understand Maslow's theory, you will have a better sense of empathy and it can help explain why people make certain decisions over others. Sacrifices are often made so another need can be sacrificed. It is definitely interesting to see how these categories play a role. For example, students often sacrifice sleep to study. They are choosing grades/academics (esteem, possibly also safety in certain scenarios) over their health (physiological). However, you can see that esteem > physiological takes precedence in this example as well in my recall situation above. The hierarchy that Maslow provides is not necessarily the order that is always followed. In addition, Maslow's theory includes a lot of generalizing and categorization to make it fit all the scenarios. It is important to keep that in mind, but it is a useful structure when looking at the big picture.

        <big><b>6/23/16 Personal Reflection</big></b><br><br>
        I am on the third week of my internship and I am feeling a bit lost. All the other interns "seem" occupied, but perhaps they feel how I feel as well. I shadow Bobby to his meetings, but am not doing much more. When I am at my desk, I just do Circle K work or find things to keep myself occupied. I don't have anything assigned to me to work on, except for maybe an hour of work on the intern project. Speaking of the intern project, the intern project is a mess. I don't want to work on it at all. We are rebranding a non-profit organization named Create Purpose but they need to help themselves before we can help them. Two people work for the nonprofit and it's a mess. They have 14 donators and it is all the founder's friends and family that have donated. This organization is a no-name organization. The East Interns are getting to work on a Dove campaign. That is so much cooler...why are we stuck with this crappy project? Kinda sucks. <br><br>
        Anyway, I don't have specific projects to work on other than just following Bobby to his meetings. I am supposed to get work soon, but I don't know when that is. The other QA Intern in the West is named Lu, and she's in the LA office. She has loads of work and actually works under Melanie, who works in SF. That's weird to me. Melanie says they will get me started soon since my role is BA + QA so I am just patiently waiting to get some assignments. I don't mind all this free time to work on my own personal stuff aka Circle K work. I'm getting paid anyway, ha.

      <big><b>6/14/16 Leadership Orientation</big></b><br><br>
      <u>PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE</u><br>

The frame I most closely identify with is a structural leader, with a score of 20. However, symbolic leader was trailing right behind, with a score of 16. This reveals that I believe strongly in the importance of clear structure and well-developed management systems, which I strongly agree. You definitely need structure to run a business, a club, a committee, etc. As a symbolic leader as well, I aspire to provide vision and inspiration to those I meet. I agree with the worksheet that I rely on personal charisma and my quirky personality.
<br>
 <br>

<u>REAL WORLD APPLICATION</u><br>

Unlike most of my peers that are interning abroad, I am interning in San Francisco and am still living in my apartment in Berkeley. In addition, I was born and raised in Los Altos, which is in the South Bay so I have basically been in this same area all my life. At my internship, everyone is laid-back and chill. The dress code is business casual, but from what I have observed it seems to be more on the casual slide. I see ripped jeans and Warriors jerseys. As long as everyone looks clean and presentable, it's fine! Everyone jokes around and it is the same Bay Area culture I have known for as long as I remember. At work, I have observed both monochronic time and polychronic time systems. Monochronic: We use the Agile and Scrum system at work, so everything is done one step at a time, under a sprint (cycle). Each week we get different tasks to work on and need to be completed in the week. Polychronic: I attend many business meetings (both client meetings and internal meetings) in a day and all of us are constantly talking notes, Skyping or Slacking each other, while talking on the WebEx conference call. I am more of a polychronic person as I believe most of us millennials are. We are multi-taskers, so we like doing many things at once. The business meetings I have observed remind me so much of my club meetings. While the meeting is going on, all of us are engaging on an activity on the side, such as texting or taking notes. Overall, there is a good structure at work. The Agile and Scrum system is really done well here. In addition, I think my boss is a good symbolic leader as everyone looks to him and runs everything by him. He is a Business Analyst so he oversees the projects that we all work on. Regarding my personal and work values, the cultural norm at my workplace is very much what I am used to. Everyone is very social and outgoing. We had "meet the interns" happy hour and I am going on a few outdoor activities such as hiking after work with my co-workers! I very much enjoy the culture at my work; it is what I have been used to all my life! :)
