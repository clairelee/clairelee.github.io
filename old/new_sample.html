<b><big>False Recognition of Unknown People</b></big>
<br><br>
	Determining whether a face is familiar or unfamiliar usually happens fairly automatically, requiring little conscious effort. As I walk through Sproul Plaza heading toward work, I pass by hundreds of people and faces. The girl in the brown hair with the pink shirt looks oddly familiar. It's Nicole from my high school! Wait, no it isn't -- she doesn't go to Berkeley! Another group of people walk past me. The boy with the blue backpack is Johnny from high school! I am wrong again. In fact, this mistaking of people happens to me quite often. I always think I see someone I recognize from my high school on campus, only to realize that this person I think I see, does not actually go to Berkeley. Thus it cannot be who I think it is. This happens almost every time I walk through campus: I keep picking out faces I think I recognize. My vision is fine: as I walk closer to them their faces do not become any clearer. It is my mind that realizes its mistake.
	<br><br>I would like to know why I keep imagining that I recognize all these people. Often on television shows, a girl thinks she sees her "crush" everywhere, because she is actively thinking about him. The "high school classmates" I observe usually are not close friends of mine, but just regular classmates that I normally used to walk past during high school passing periods. They are not people I still talk to on a regular basis. This immediately eliminates the hypothesis that I am "daydreaming about" or "thinking of" these people, leading to why I falsely recognize them on Berkeley campus.
	<br><br>During lecture, Professor Whitney taught us about Patient MR. The patient is reported who is able to correctly recognize famous people as being familiar but has a strong tendency to falsely recognize unfamiliar people as being familiar. However, false recognition does not depend on the type of person involved (contemporary, historical, fictional) or the modality in which it is presented (face, spoken/written name).  False recognition of faces has found to be associated with fronto-temporal dementia with prosopagnosia.  This proves true, as the temporal lobe of the brain is partly responsible for our ability to recognize faces. The Fusiform Face Area (FFA) is located in the ventral stream on the ventral surface of the temporal lobe on the lateral side of the fusiform gyrus. The FFA is the part of the human visual system that is specialized for facial recognition. Accordingly, some neurons in the temporal lobe respond to particular features of faces. Some people who suffer damage to the temporal lobe lose their ability to recognize and identify familiar faces, known as prosopagnosia. These are all facts that have been discussed in lecture by Professor Whitney regarding brain damage and prosopagnosia. I hypothesize that I, similar to MR, suffer from prosopagnosia, but perhaps a lesser degree.
	<br><br>However, I have no recollection of damaging my brain. In "Component Structure of Individual Differences in True and False Recognition of Faces," the authors state:
"Damage to the right occipitotemporal brain region is linked to deficits in face recognition memory [...] Right frontal damage is linked to face-recognition deficits as well. It is important that deficits due to right occipitotemporal damage differ qualitatively from deficits due to frontal damage in that the former involved decreased correct recognition whereas the latter involved increased false recognition."
In my observations, I incorrectly recognize faces I do not actually know. Thus, going along the previously mentioned hypothesis, I should have right frontal damage to the brain. Reading ahead, I am glad to see that "Healthy older adults resemble patients with frontal lobe damage in the deficits they show in face recognition," through tests they have performed that show high false alarm rates in face recognition tasks. On the basis of their observations, Rapcsak et al. (1999) proposed a neuropsychological model of face recognition.
According to the model, a "frontal executive system" works to
reduce false recognition through several processes that include
"strategic search," "effortful recollection" of contextual information,
monitoring the contents of memory retrieval, and decision-making
processes. An occipitotemporal component was proposed in which they
characterized as a "face recognition module." This component supports recognition of previously viewed faces by signaling resemblance between a face being currently viewed and stored memory representations of previously seen faces.
	<br><br>My "component," if it exists, must be the part of my brain that is incorrectly recognizing these unfamiliar people I pass. This must happen because after walking around my high school campus for four years, the faces and people I used to walk past have been engrained in my memory. In high school, I essentially was able to recognize every single person I walked past in the hallways. Now, walking through campus at a large university, perhaps my mind has not adjusted to the fact that I do not know 99% of the people I pass. A key claim for the aforementioned model says that the face recognition module could often signal strong resemblance even for new faces, leading to the false recognition that occurs. This occurs because all faces share the same "first-order configuration" such as hairline above eyes and eyes above nose, and faces of different persons can be highly similar in their features. "Face recognition is one of the most difficult visual tasks humans perform, because faces are so similar," says Michael J. Tarr, associate professor of cognitive and linguistic sciences at Brown University.
<br><br>Finally, I explore the concept of "recognition memory." A subcategory of declarative memory, recognition memory is the ability to recognize previously encountered events, objects, or people. When the previously experienced event is re-experienced, this environmental content is matched to stored memory representations, eliciting matching signals. Recognition memory can be subdivided into two component processes: recollection and familiarity. Recollection is the retrieval of details associated with the previously experienced event, while familiarity is the feeling that the event was previously experienced, without recollection. Thus, I conclude that walking through UC Berkeley campus triggers the memories I have of walking through my high school campus.
	<br><br>For future exploration of false recognition of people, I would like to hear first-hand experiences from people other than myself that experience this phenomenon. I would like to gather data from young children, young adults, older adults, and also individuals with confirmed cases of prosopagnosia. In addition, it would be interesting to test this occurrence in different settings. If I were to go to a new, crowded mall, do I also falsely recognize the shoppers? Finally, a smaller-scale test that could be done in a lab is to show a participant many photos of different individuals, repeat some, and have the participant identify which ones are repeated.
	<br><br>Face recognition involves a number of complex cognitive processes in the brain.
A proposed "face recognition model" maps out how false facial recognition, a memory distortion in which one mistakenly believes that new faces are familiar, may occur, even in individuals that do not suffer from prosopagnosia. False face recognitions are generally prompted by familiarity cues and occur more frequently with older adults. I am only nineteen, but perhaps my face recognition module has already aged beyond my years.
