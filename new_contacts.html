        1. <b>Patrick O'Leary</b><br>
        <i>Manager, Digital Product Management, Razorfish</i><br>
        Patrick was my manager at Razorfish during Summer 2016. He wants me to grow and learn and served as my "mentor" during my time at Razorfish. I know he has my best interests at heart and is a great person for my professional network.<br><br>

        2. <b>Bobby Sabnani</b><br>
        <i>Manager, Digital Product Management, Razorfish</i><br>
        Bobby was one of my bosses that assigned me projects during my internships at Razorfish in Summer 2016. I shadowed him at his meetings (and he had like 5 meetings a day!). Bobby is the best of the best, and everyone that I met at Razorfish has told me that Bobby is one of the best PM's out there. I was blessed to be placed under him and have learned a lot about being a PM. I wish to be as successful as him if I pursue becoming a PM! He has taught me a lot and provided resources such as good books to read. He is definitely a great asset to my professional network.<br><br>

        3. <b>Kris Kepler</b><br>
        <i>Experience Director, Razorfish</i><br>
        Kris Kepler is #goals. I met her Summer 2016 at Razorfish. She is a UX Director, meaning that she gets to boss other UX people around and offer recommendations. She knows so much about UX and I wish to be as knowledgable as her in this field. <br><br>

        4. <b>Sarah Spitler</b><br>
        <i>Senior Experience Designer, Razorfish</i><br>
        I met Sarah because I attended many of her CRUX team meetings Summer 2016 at Razorfish. She is a great UX Designer and always considers different options and values feedback. I love how she carries a litle notebook around and jots down notes. As an aspiring UX Designer, I am glad to have met Sarah to add her to my professional network.<br><br>

        5. <b>Jennifer Kumura</b><br>
        <i>User Experience Associate, Razorfish</i><br>
        I met Jenn because I attended many of her CRUX team meetings Summer 2016 at Razorfish. She can be an important part of my professional network by offering me guidance for User Experience Design roles and general knowledge as well.<br><br>

        6. <b>Jennifer Cheng</b><br>
        <i>Senior QA Analyst, Razorfish</i><br>
        Jennifer was another one of my bosses Summer 2016 at Razorfish. She is great at catching bugs, and I often ask her for help and instructions during my time at Razorfish. She can be an important part of my professional network since she has worked across so many different teams and with so many people on numerous web development projects. She can definitely introduce me to other great people.<br><br>

        7. <b>Ferris Thomas</b><br>
        <i>Principal Software Engineer, Razorfish</i><br>
        Ferris was a fantastic engineer that I worked alongside with Summer 2016 at Razorfish. I haven't ruled out software engineering as a possible career role for me, so Ferris can definitely offer me guidance and point me toward the right direction.<br><br>

        8. <b>Such Patel</b><br>
        <i>Associate QA Manager, Razorfish</i><br>
        Such was my buddy at Razorfish during Summer 2016. He has my best interests at heart and has worked in the tech industry for quite some time. I can always look to him for guidance, and he's great for my professional network. He can point me toward the right people and explain different career opportunities to me.<br><br>

        9. <b>Evelyn Chan</b><br>
        <i>Senior Project Manager, Razorfish</i><br>
        Evelyn was the PM for one of the projects I worked on during Summer 2016 at Razorfish. I admire her so much! She has her plate full with so many things and her emails and Slack are always blowing up. Yet she can keep track of everything. Working alongside her has inspired me to pursue a career in PM, and I know Evelyn would be great to help me explore that role.<br><br>

        10. <b>Jinhee Hong</b><br>
        <i>Senior Designer, Razorfish</i><br>
        Jinhee was a designer on one of my projects I worked at during Summer 2016 at Razorfish. She would receive wireframes from the UX team and create designs with Adobe Illustrator. She is an important part of my professional network since hse can explain how the UX and Creative Teams differ at workplaces, and how UX and Design can be separated into different roles.<br><br>
